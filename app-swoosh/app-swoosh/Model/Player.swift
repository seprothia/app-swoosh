// Structs are faster than classes...
struct Player {
    var desiredLeague: String!
    var selectedSkillLevel: String!
}

// PRO TIP - all the data in your app should be in a struct or class. Don't pass around multiple variables between view controllers.

// It's reusable..testable...safer...cleaner...
